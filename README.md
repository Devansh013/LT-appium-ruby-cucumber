*Cucumber is a free and open source behavior-driven development (BDD) tool that supports the development process. Its ordinary language parser, Gherkin, allows software behavior to be specified in a logical language that anyone can understand.*

## Cucumber With Appium

This article will guide you in getting started with configuring and running your Ruby:Cucumber-based Appium automation test scripts on the **LambdaTest Real Device Cloud Platform**.

## Objective

1.  Set up an environment for testing your Apps using **Cucumber** with **Appium**.
2.  Understand and configure the core capabilities required for your Appium test suite.
3.  Explore the advanced features of LambdaTest.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing Ruby automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

- Install **Ruby** and **gem** on your local system. Follow these instructions to install on different operating systems.

  - For **Windows**, you can download from the [official website](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
  - For **Linux** or **Ubuntu**, you can run a simple apt command like below:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ruby-full
    ```

  - For **macOS**, you can run a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) command like this:

    ```bash
    brew install ruby
    ```

- Ensure you have Dependency manager **bundler** installed. If not installed, you can install with the following command -

  ```
  gem install bundler
  ```

### Clone The Sample Project

**Step-1:** Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s [LT_Ruby_Appium](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-cucumber) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-cucumber
cd LT-appium-ruby-cucumber
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).

**Step-2:** Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \\
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}"
  
**For Windows:**

  {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}"
  
### Upload Your Application

**Step-3:** Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" \\
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \\
--form 'name="Android_App"' \\
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
`}

**For Windows;**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""`}

**Using App URL:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" \\
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \\
--form 'name="Android_App"' \\
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'`}

**For Windows:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{\"url\":\"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk\",\"name\":\"sample.apk\"}"`}

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Cucumber test on LambdaTest.

Test Scenario: Check out [Android.rb](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-cucumber/blob/master/Android/examples/First_test/features/step_definitions/first_steps.rb) file to view the sample test script for android and [iOS.rb](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-ruby-cucumber/blob/master/iOS/examples/First_test/features/step_definitions/first_steps.rb) for iOS.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

**Step-4:** You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios-config" label="iOS" default>

```ruby title="iOS(.ipa)"
server: "beta-hub.lambdatest.com"

common_caps:
  "user": "LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
  "accessKey": "LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
  "project": "First Cucumber Android Project"
  "build": "build-1"


browser_caps:
  -
    "platformName": "iOS"
    "platformVersion": "12.0"
    "deviceName": "iPhone 8"
    "app": "YOUR_APP_URL"
    "name": "first_test"
    "isRealMobile": "true"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android-config" label="Android" default>

```ruby title="Android(.apk)"
server: "beta-hub.lambdatest.com"

common_caps:
  "user": "LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
  "accessKey": "LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
  "project": "First Cucumber Android Project"
  "build": "build-1"


browser_caps:
  -
    "platformName": "Android"
    "platformVersion": "9"
    "deviceName": "Galaxy S8 Plus"
    "app": "YOUR_APP_URL"
    "name": "first_test"
    "isRealMobile": "true"
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/beta/index.html)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/).

### Executing The Tests

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

If you are using an **iOS** app, the cURL command will generate an app URL for the corresponding iOS app and install the same for running the tests. You can either use our sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa) or upload your own app as discussed earlier.

**Step-5:** Navigate to the corresponding directory based on your app.

```bash
cd ios
```

**Step-6:** Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
bundle exec rake first
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

If you are using an **android** app, the cURL command will generate an app URL for the corresponding Android app and install the same for running the tests. You can either use our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or upload your own app as discussed earlier.

**Step-5:** Navigate to the corresponding directory based on your app.

```bash
cd android
```

**Step-6:** Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
bundle exec rake first
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info:** Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the :link: [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
